**What is Pacco?**
----------------

Pacco is an open source project using **microservices architecture** written in .NET Core 3.1. The domain tackles an exclusive parcels delivery which revolves around the general concept of limited resources availability. Pacco does use an **event-driven** approach in order to asynchronously integrate between the microservices.

The solution is maintained by **[devmentors.io](https://devmentors.io)**.

----------------

The overall solution makes use of the **cloud agnostic** tools and most of them can be found under [cncf.io](https://cncf.io). To easily plug into the complex infrastructure, [Convey](https://convey-stack.github.io) is being used.

----------------

Depending on the particular microservice complexity, either the clean architecture + DDD approach (as presented below) is used or another style that is the best fit.

**Which repositories should I clone?**
----------------

Please clone the following repositories and put them into the same working directory:

- [Pacco](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco)
- [Pacco.APIGateway](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco.APIGateway)
- [Pacco.Services.Availability](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco.Services.Availability)
- [Pacco.Services.Customers](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco.Services.Customers)
- [Pacco.Services.Deliveries](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco.Services.Deliveries)
- [Pacco.Services.Identity](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco.Services.Identity)
- [Pacco.Services.Operations](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco.Services.Operations)
- [Pacco.Services.OrderMaker](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco.Services.OrderMaker)
- [Pacco.Services.Orders](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco.Services.Orders)
- [Pacco.Services.Parcels](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco.Services.Parcels)
- [Pacco.Services.Pricing](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco.Services.Pricing)
- [Pacco.Services.Vehicles](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco.Services.Vehicles)

The above repositories can be also cloned via [git-clone.sh](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco/blob/master/scripts/git-clone.sh) script and updated via [git-pull.sh](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco/blob/master/scripts/git-pull.sh) script. Simply, copy the scripts to the directory next to the `Pacco` on your local drive, and execute them using shell. Inside `Pacco`, you will also find [Pacco.sln](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco/blob/master/Pacco.sln)  that aggregates all the microservices under a single solution, in order to make it easier to work with during the local development.

**How to start the solution?**
----------------

Open `Pacco/compose` directory and execute:

```
docker-compose -f infrastructure.yml up -d
```

It will start the required infrastructure in the background. Then, you can start the services independently of each other via `dotnet run` or `./scripts/start.sh` command in each microservice repository or run them all at once using Docker:

```
docker-compose -f services-local.yml up
```

**What HTTP requests can be sent to the API?**
----------------

You can find the list of all HTTP requests in [Pacco-sample-scenario.rest](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco.APIGateway/blob/master/Pacco-sample-scenario.rest) file placed in the root folder of [Pacco.APIGateway](https://github.com/devmentors/Pacco.APIGateway) repository. 
This file is compatible with [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) plugin for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
